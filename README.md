# Intelligent-Scissors
Intelligent Scissors with Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra)  This project showcases the implementation of an intelligent scissor tool that enables precise cropping of objects within an image. Powered by the efficient Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, the scissor tool intelligently identifies the optimal path along object boundaries.
